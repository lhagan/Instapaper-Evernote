This is a simple AppleScript that will add all links from an [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) page to Evernote.

To use, simply navigate to the Instapaper folder you want to export in Safari, then run the script. It only loads links on the current page, so if your folder has multiple pages that you want to import, you'll have to run the script once on **each** page. Once complete, you might want to use the *ARCHIVE ALL* feature in Instapaper to clear out the exported items.
